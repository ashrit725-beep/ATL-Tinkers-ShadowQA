# ShadowQA — PRD

## Original problem statement
Build ShadowQA: a production-quality autonomous debugging and QA agent embedded in the web application developers already use (Zero-UI / ambient agent). Loop: OBSERVE → UNDERSTAND → DIAGNOSE → PLAN → ACT → VALIDATE → REPLAY → VERIFY, with real browser instrumentation, correlation engine, context graph, source maps, secure local workspace bridge, structured AI orchestrator, minimal diffs, risk engine, human control, checkpoints/rollback, adaptive validation, failure replay, autonomous QA mode, application memory, observability, git/PR integration, security model, graceful failure handling, premium minimal UI, a polished demo e-commerce app with realistic bugs, docs and tests. Theme: "Agents are leaving the chatbox" — the browser/dev environment is the place.

Positioning (user-mandated, 2026-06): ShadowQA does NOT compete with Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot on "who writes code better". Their model: developer tells AI about a task → AI works on the codebase. ShadowQA: application experiences something → observes → understands context → acts on the codebase → verifies the result. Differentiation = where the context comes from and when it acts. Hackathon goal: 10/10 rubric, zero bugs, premium polish.

## User choices
- LLM: user's own Anthropic key → `claude-sonnet-4-6` (primary), OpenAI `gpt-5.4` fallback. Both verified live 2026-06 (ping round-trips through `llm.complete_json`).
- Git: local branch + PR-ready summary for the demo (no `GITHUB_REPO`); real PR supported when configured.
- Delivery: embedded runtime SDK + Chrome MV3 extension wrapper (`extension/shadowqa.js`, rebuilt via `yarn build:sdk`).
- Autonomy: auto-apply LOW risk, approval for MEDIUM/HIGH; QA-discovered incidents always queue for review.

## Architecture
- Frontend `src/shadowqa/` vanilla-JS SDK: observers (runtime/network/interaction — JSON response shape sample captured, redacted), ring buffer, detector (resettable dedupe), capture, bridge client (keepalive observe), replay engine, QA runner, memory heartbeat (timer-only, no unload flush), Shadow-DOM Zero-UI overlay with persistent elements + change-detecting `patchHtml` (no re-animation on poll), 11-tab inspector.
- Frontend `src/shadowqa/center/` React Command Center at `/shadowqa`: CenterHeader (bridge LED, git, model, autonomy switch, Run QA sweep), hero + stats, LoopPanel (7 stages w/ latency), WhyPanel (Claude Code/Cursor/Copilot vs ShadowQA, filled with the latest incident's live data), IncidentTable (row → inspector), ScenarioPanel (3 bugs + Reset), HealthPanel, ContextPanel (signal kinds), AgentPanel (latency, LLM calls, audit), MemoryPanel (known failures, APIs, routes).
- Backend `shadowqa/`: token-gated API, pipeline state machine, source-map resolver, correlation + context graph + replay plan, targeted retrieval, orchestrator (bounded loop, robust `extract_json` for prose+fenced JSON, in-conversation repair round, provider fallback w/ gpt-5 temperature rule), patch engine, risk engine, validation engine, checkpoint/rollback, git plumbing, memory (input-tolerant), QA flows (11 declared), audit, telemetry, demo reset/scenarios from pristine copies in `scripts/demo_bugs/`.
- Demo `Lumen Supply Co.`: login, dashboard, products (wishlist toggle), product detail, cart (promo bug), checkout (contract bug), orders, order detail + tracking (legacy-shape bug), wishlist, account, help/support, settings.

## Intentional demo bugs (NEVER fix by hand; pristine copies in scripts/demo_bugs/)
1. `frontend/src/demo/api/payments.js` sends `total` (gateway requires `amount`) → 422 + TypeError in Checkout.jsx.
2. `frontend/src/demo/lib/promo.js` case-sensitive promo lookup → TypeError reading 'rate'.
3. `frontend/src/demo/api/store.js` `fetchTracking` unwraps `data.tracking` from an unwrapped v2 response → GET 200 then TypeError reading 'events' in OrderDetail.jsx (a *successful* request that breaks the UI).
Reset: `POST /api/shadowqa/demo/reset`, Command Center button, or `scripts/reset_demo.sh`.

## Implemented & verified (2026-06, iteration 2 — /app/test_reports/iteration_2.json)
- Command Center built (was a missing import → whole app compile error) and verified at 1920/390.
- Tracking bug loop: verified in ~28 s, cause pinned to store.js:9 by claude-sonnet-4-6, replay renders tracking timeline.
- Checkout loop regression verified (~32 s), Undo restores bug. Claude prose+fenced JSON now parses (previously → diagnosis_failed).
- Overlay flicker ("spacing out") fixed: same `.card` DOM node persists across polls.
- Stuck "replaying" after an interrupted reload fixed (resume once, then fail+rollback).
- GPT-5.4 fallback fixed (temperature), verified live.
- QA sweep from Command Center: 13 flows, failures queued for review, Investigate → View Fix → Apply → verified.
- Backend 38/38 pytest, Jest 7/7. Docs (README, DEMO, ARCHITECTURE) updated with positioning + third bug + Command Center.

## Backlog
- P1: "before fix" reproduction replay (prove the failure reproduces prior to patching) as extra evidence.
- P1: per-tab session isolation for concurrent tabs; TypeScript typecheck validator; pytest related tests for backend patches.
- P2: multi-incident queue UI; scheduled regression alerts; Slack/GitHub notifications; extension icons/store packaging; set `GITHUB_REPO` for real PRs.

## Next tasks
1. Optional: provide GitHub repo → validate real PR flow.
2. Testing-agent regression pass after any SDK/overlay change (reset demo at the end).
